## Summary

The goal of the porject was to assess risk to the Bering and Chukchi Seas coast from vessels that had gone adrift,
run aground, breached, and then spilt oil on the coast.

## Data

### Data on Gluster

The project working directoy is on `/mnt/store/data/assets/nps-vessel-spills/` which contains everything related to project,
but is too big to be included in the repo.

#### Regional risk files

Parquet files containing the oil spill hazard,

#### Normalized regional risk files

Same as the regional risk files, but the risk and hazard are normalized by the maximum value within the region.


## Code (src)

The scripts for processing the data for simulations, running, the simulations, and analyzing the simulations are contained
in the pip installable `vessel-drift-analysis` package.

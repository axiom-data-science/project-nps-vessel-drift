# NPS - Vessel Drift Analysis

## Summary

This repo is an archive of code, simulation results, and notebooks for the [Bering Sea Drift and Spill Vessel](https://spillanddrift.srv.axds.co) project to estimate the risk of oil spill to Alaskan shores from grounded vessels.

The goal of the project was to better understand the risks associated with vessel traffic in the Bering and Chukchi Seas to the Alaskan shoreline. This included estimating the probability of vessels drifting and running aground, estimating the likelihood of a grounded vessel spilling oil, and risk posed to coastal areas from oil spilled from such a vessel.

The project incorporated data from an industry database of 3000+ vessel incidents from Alaskan waters, a NOAA incident database, and a State of Alaska incident database to develop realistic parameters for the likelihood and duration of vessel drift events into drift simulation models.
